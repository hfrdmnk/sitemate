# SiteMate Project Information

## Project Overview
SiteMate is a website quality assurance tool for web agencies and developers. It scans websites to detect issues like broken links, missing images, SEO problems, and performance issues.

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Laravel 12
- Frontend: Inertia.js v2 with React + TypeScript
- UI: shadcn/ui components + Tailwind CSS
- Database & Queue: Just use the facades, Laravel provides

## Key Concepts
- **Audit**: Main entity that represents a website quality assurance report
- **Page**: Individual pages, that were scanned for the site/report they belong to
- **Issues**: Problems found during scanning, categorized by modules

## Architecture
SiteMate uses a modular approach with specialized modules for different check types:
- Links Module
- Images Module
- SEO Module
- Performance Module

## Models Relationship
- An Audit has multiple Pages
- A Page belongs to at least one Audit (but can belong to more, if the site hasn't changed between Audits)
- Each Issue belongs to exactly one Page

## Main Features
- Website crawling and analysis
- Issue detection and reporting
- Historical tracking of website quality
- Public tools for basic scanning (extracted from the core functionality and available without log in â€“ used as a lead magnet)

When creating or modifying code, ensure proper integration with this architecture and maintain the modular approach. Follow Laravel best practices and maintain consistency with the existing codebase.
